        "- Vegetarian: No meat, poultry, fish, or seafood. May include eggs and dairy.\n",

        "- Gluten-free: No wheat, barley, rye, or derivatives. Note that regular all-purpose flour contains gluten.\n",

        "- Nut-free: No tree nuts or peanuts.\n",
        "- Egg-free: No eggs or products containing eggs.\n",
